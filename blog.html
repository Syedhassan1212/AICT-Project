        <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices for 2025</h2>
        <p>With cyber threats becoming more sophisticated, businesses must prioritize robust cybersecurity strategies. In 2025, zero-trust architecture, AI-based threat detection, and regular employee training will be essential to protect sensitive data. Organizations must also stay updated with compliance regulations and invest in proactive security measures.</p>
        <p>One effective approach is conducting regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and address them promptly. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and end-to-end encryption are becoming standard practices to safeguard digital assets. Additionally, educating employees about phishing attacks and social engineering tactics is critical to minimizing human error as a potential weak link in cybersecurity.</p>
